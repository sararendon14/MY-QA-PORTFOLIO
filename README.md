About me üëãüèæüñ•Ô∏è

Hi, my name is Sara. Since the beginning of 2023 I have been studying and practicing to become a QA. I am happy to have finally found an area in which I can successfully develop myself. Since I am learning Polish Sign Language, the subject of accessibility is particularly important to me. In the QA position I see the potential to make, at the very least, the digital world more welcoming for every person. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have gained through courses, self-study and my job. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also started learning test automation in, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area.

My experience üè¢


I have also started learning test automation and gained familiarity with tools like Selenium and basic scripting in Python. My knowledge in frontend programming languages gives me a deeper understanding of how products are built, which allows me to test with a developer‚Äôs perspective in mind. I am continuously learning and pushing myself to grow in the field of test automation.

Currently, I am studying at CESDE and focused on improving my technical skills and staying up-to-date with industry best practices. Accessibility is an important topic for me, especially as I am learning Polish Sign Language, and I believe the role of QA is critical in making the digital world more inclusive for everyone.

This portfolio highlights my practical experience and knowledge acquired through my work, self-study, and various courses. I am committed to continuing my journey in this field and embracing new challenges along the way.
